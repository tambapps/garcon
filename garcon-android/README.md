# Android Garcon

This gar√ßon implements the HTTP/1.1 on its own (or at least try to respect it), it doesn't need any dependencies

It requires Java 8+ and can be used on Android, especially on the 
[Android Groovy Shell](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tambapps.android.grooidshell)
