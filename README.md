# Garçon - lightweight HTTP Server library for Groovy

Garçon (pronounced `gar·son`, as in [garcon de café](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gar%C3%A7on_de_caf%C3%A9)) is a lightweight HTTP Server library with **no dependencies** and
**compatible with Android**.

The library is designed for Groovy, but it also has a Java version that doesn't require Groovy.
